crumble \- Lossy compression of DNA sequence quality values

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBcrumble\fR [\fIoptions\fR] [\fIinput_file\fR [\fIoutput_file\fR]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBCrumble\fR reads an aligned SAM, BAM or CRAM file, performs lossy
compression of the quality values based on the consistency of the
multiple alignment, and writes a modified SAM, BAM or CRAM file.
Reading and writing can be to stdin and stdout, either by omitting the
field or specifying the filename as "\fB-\fR".
.PP
The method of quality compression stems from observations of how
quality values affect variant calling algorithms.  If we run a variant
caller on a file with and without quality values and get the same
result with comparable confidence both times, then we conclude the
quality values were not important and can be discarded.
.PP
We do not wish to know the internals of each possible variant caller,
so instead use a deliberately simplistic but pessimistic consensus
algorithm, capable of calling homozygous and heterozygous calls for a
single diploid sample with an associated consensus confidence.  It
does this without the use of a reference sequence, using solely the
data within the aligned BAM.  If we are unsure of the accuracy of our
consensus call then we keep the qualities intact or apply only a light
smoothing filter, otherwise we adjust the qualities to fixed values to
reduce the overall variability, and thus entropy, increasing
compression ratios.
.PP
\fBCrumble\fR can compute the consensus with and/or without using
mapping quality.  By default it only computes it once (with), but if
both consensus methods are requested then each will have its own set
of thresholds to use in validation.  The minimum quality threshold
(\fB-q\fR and \fB-Q\fR) needs to be above zero in order for that
consensus method to be used.
.PP
\fBCrumble\fR uses the consensus confidence plus heuristics listed
below to classify positions into good and bad.  A good region will
have the qualities modified; bases in that column that agree with the
homozygous or heterozygous consensus call will have their quality
values increased to a fixed value (specified by \fB-u\fR), while bases
that disagree with have their values either decreased (specified by
\fB-l\fR) or heavily quantised (\fB-l\fR, \fB-c\fR and \fB-u\fR).  In
all other regions, \fBcrumble\fR either keeps the quality values
intact or performs a simple smoothing (using the CSAM P-block
algorithm with level indicated by \fB-p\fR).  A global upper-bound
quality value can be set using the \fB-U\fR option, which can be used
to set a cap on excessively high qualities such as seen in PacBio HiFi.
.PP
A series of heuristics are employed to further filter high confidence
consensus bases in case of systematic problems, to prevent seemingly
confident but incorrect consensus calls leading to inappropriate
quality loss.  The possible heuristics that are applied depend on the
compression level used.  Some are per column, such as consensus
confidence, while others are per read.  In the latter case, if we
determine the whole read is potentially misplaced / misaligned then we
preserve qualities for the entire read and not just the column being
studied.

.TP 4
.B Per base: SNP / Indel confidence
This is the starting point for deciding whether to keep a quality.  An
indel in this situation is considered to be any column where at least
one base is either absent or inserted with respect to the reference
coordinate system.

If the consensus confidence is below the minimum specified
confidence for a SNP (\fB-Q\fR and/or \fB-q\fR depending on whether
the consensus algorithm is using mapping quality) or an indel (\fB-D\fR
or \fB-d\fR) it will be retained.

.TP 4
.B Per base: consensus discrepancy
The consensus will make either a homozygous or heterozygous call, but
there may be bases present that disagree.  By computing a new consensus
solely from these discrepant bases and comparing this to the original
call we get a discrepancy factor.  High discrepancy (above 1) may be
indicative of misaligned data.  Specified using the \fB-X\fR and
\fB-x\fR parameters.

.TP 4
.B Per base: 'keep' bed file
Any base which overlaps the regions specified in the bed file
(\fB-b\fR) will be retained verbatim.

.TP 4
.B Per base: proximity to SNP / Indel
A short tandem repeat (STR) with indels will often lead to misaligned
bases.  A variant caller may employ a local reassembly method to tidy
up alignments in such regions, but this has the effect of moving bases
between columns which in turn may invalidate our calculations of which
columns are high confidence.  We can compensate for this by preserve
qualities spanning the entire STR plus a little bit more either side,
either as a proportion of the STR length or a fixed number of base pairs.

For any location where \fBCrumble\fR wants to preserve base
confidences using the above rules, it checks whether this base forms
part of an STR and if so computes the start and end of this STR.  It
then expands the region to preserve qualities using \fBnew_start = pos - (pos -
start) * STR_mul - STR_add\fR and \fBnew_end = pos + (end - pos) * STR_mul +
STR_add\fR where \fIpos\fR is the current location.
We have SNP and Indel specific versions of these multiply and addition
parameters, specified using \fB\s\fR and \fB-i\fR.  These are specified
as the multiplier and additive values separated with a comma.  For
example \fB-i1.5,1\fR will make preserve qualities for 50% larger plus
1 extra bp on either side of the STR.

Platforms with an inherently large indel error rate may wish to use
the \fB-Y\fR \fIfraction\fR option to restrict the STR assessment to
columns where the number of reads containing indels are above a given
threshold.  This can be a significant performance gain on such data.

.TP 4
.B Per read: excessive depth
Regions of collapsed repeats or large insertions being aligned to the
next best reference match lead to high depth.  Typically such
locations can yield overly confident heterozygous variant calls.
The average depth is predominantly from the previous Mb of consensus.
A column with depth more than \fB-P\fR \fIdepth\fR times the average
will have mean all qualities for reads overlapping that quality will
be retained, not just in that column alone.

.TP 4
.B Per read: high proportion of low mapping quality
Regions where most of the reads have low mapping quality are either
repeat copies or, potentially, incorrect reference.  An updated
reference may move these reads and we may not wish to pre-judge
whether their quality values will be necessary after remapping.
Controlled by the \fB-M\fR option, which should be a fraction between
0.0 (keep qualities if any low mapping quality data is present) and
1.0 (do not use this rule).

Note that all reads in regions matching this rule will be have their
qualities preserved, not just the low mapping quality ones.

.TP 4
.B Per read: high proportion of soft-clipping
Many reads having soft-clipped portions of their CIGAR strings is
indicative of either a missing insertion or a collapsed repeat.
Relying on the validity of the consensus call and confidence in this
case can be wrong.   The \fB-C\fR option specifies the fraction of
reads present in order to retain quality values, with 1.0 disabling
this rule.

.TP 4
.B Per read: variability in indel size
Given we are targeting a diploid single sample file, the length of
indels should be at most bi-modal in distribution.  We find the two
most frequent lengths of indel and count the proportion of other
lengths over all reads spanning the indel at this region.  If it is
too high (above the fraction in \fB-Z\fR option), then there may be
additional alignment problems causing bases to be in incorrect
columns.

.TP 4
.B Per read: low proportion of reads spanning indel
A pairwise alignment naturally leads to some reads ending within an
indel, which in turn leads to the number of reads spanning the indel
being slightly lower than the number of reads flanking it.  However
too large a drop is sometimes indicative of a large structural
variation or a misalignment.  We keep qualities if the fraction of
reads overlapping the indel is lower than the amount specified by
\fB-V\fR, with zero disabling this filter.


.SH OPTIONS
.PP
All the compound options such as \fB-1\fR to \fB-9\fR should be
specified first, followed by instrument options (\fB-y\fR) and then
other options.  This avoids \fB-9\fR from overwriting any option changes
already made.

-i1.0,2 -m0\fR.

.PP
.TP
\fB-Y\fR \fIplatform\fR
Recommended options for a specific platform.  This option should come
after any \fB-1\fR to \fB-9\fR option and before others.

The current supported \fIplatform\fR strings are "illumina" which does
nothing as the defaults are for this instrument, and "pbccs" with the
latter being equivalent to \fB-Y0.1 -u50 -U50 -p16\fR.

.PP
.TP
\fB-b\fR \fIout.bed\fR
Writes out a bed file containing regions that trigger the various
heuristics that \fBcrumble\fI uses to preserve quality values.

.PP
.TP
\fB-B\fR
Enables binary quality mode.  If the \fB-L 1\fR option (enabled by
default) is used to reduce mismatching qualities, bases in good
regions that disagree with the called consensus will be modified.
Without the binary quality mode these will be set to a constant low
value, specified by the \fB-l\fR parameter.  With binary quality mode,
these are instead quantised to two values; low and high as governed by
the \fB-l\fR, \fB-u\fR and \fB-c\fR parameters.

.PP
.TP
\fB-C\fR \fIfloat\fR
Keep all qualities for reads at this site if >= \fIfloat\fR proportion
of reads have soft-clipping.

.PP
.TP

.TQ
\fB-u\fR \fIqual_upper\fR
In highly confident regions, quality are quantised into those \fI>=
qual_cutoff\fR  and those \fI< qual_cutoff\fR, being replaced by
\fIqual_upper\fR and \fIqual_lower\fR respectively.

.PP
.TP
\fB-U\fR \fIqual_cap\fR
An absolute upper limit on quality values.  This is useful with PacBio
HiFi data with an unrealistic (and expensive) large range of qualities.
This is performed right at the start of the Crumble algorithm and
applies to all data, even those that are otherwise kept intact.

.PP
.TP
\fB-d\fR \fIqual\fR
Keep quality for bases at this position if the consensus indel
confidence when computed without mapping quality is < \fIqual\fR.

.PP
.TP
\fB-L\fR \fIbool\fR
If \fIbool\fR is 1 (the default), quality values for bases overlapping
high confidence consensus locations that do not match the consensus
call will have their qualities adjusted.  These will either be
quantised to \fIqual_lower\fR or \fIqual_upper\fR if binary
quantisation is enabled (see \fB-B\fR) or set to \fIqual_lower\fR if
no quantisation is happening.  Also see \fB-l\fR, \fB-c\fR and

.TP
\fB-p\fR \fIspan\fR
Applies the P-block algorithm from libCSAM.  For qualities that we
wish to keep, we still have the option of reducing their fidelity

The heterozygous deletion at 1488399 is neighboured by TCTC STR to the
left and poly-A to the right, extended by an additional 2bp either
side.  Qualities outside this region are replaced with Q40 while
qualities inside are smoothed linearly along each read.
